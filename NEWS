0.8.0

0.7.0 (2017-06-12)
------------------

 * Update sigrok-cli to the new APIs from both libsigrok 0.5.0 and also
   libsigrokdecode 0.5.0.
 * -P <decoder> --show:
   - List the binary output classes of the decoder.
   - List the possible input and output IDs of the decoder.
 * --help:
   - Clarify that --show also lists input/output format options,
     as well as protocol decoder options (bug #851).
   - Show a few typical invocations of e.g. --samples/--time/--continuous.
 * Add an -L|--list-supported option; this used to be part of -V (bug #604).
 * Drop the superfluous -S|--protocol-decoder-stack option. Stacking can
   be done by simply using -P and providing the decoders in the correct order.
 * Allow multiple -P options to decode multiple stacks (bug #868).
 * Show decoder instance IDs so the user can tell instances apart (bug #868).
 * Show annotations based on decoder ID (not instance ID).
   - Behaviour preserved:
     Single PD, no -A flag => all annotations from PD
     Single PD, -A pdid => all annotations from PD
     Single PD, -A pdid=annX => annX from PD
   - Behaviour now added:
     Duplicate PDs, no -A flag => all annotations from all PDs
     Duplicate PDs, -A pdid => all annotations from all PDs of type pdid
     Duplicate PDs, -A pdid=annX => all annX from all PDs of type pdid
 * Fix various memory leaks.
 * ./configure summary: Show linker flags used.
 * NSIS:
   - Update to Python 3.4.x. We can't use any higher version for the time
     being, since 3.4.x is the last version to support Windows XP.
   - Place the example .sr files in a separate installer section.
   - Limit example .sr files to a small set to shrink the installer size.
   - Clarify Start menu links (e.g. "Uninstall") to avoid confusion.
 * HACKING: Update URL to Linux kernel coding style.
 * Fix some compiler warnings (clang).
